WhenIsItOn?

Baseline goal:
Simple site with just a clean page with a search box.
Attempts auto complete as you type showing a small image of the show. (only do a live search once a second or so...)
    - have a local db(mongo?) that stores the names of all recent shows. use that for live search
next page simply shows the next date of the next airing episode if it can.

possible future features:
have a few images of the show.
perhaps synopsis of the episode hidden by default click to show
remind me when show will come back option


using OMDb API for searching. provides better more relevant results
tvmaze api for next episode. easier to use
